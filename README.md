# Hexx Bot

A bot that has lots of commands and is fun and has moderation commands.


## The whole tour

On the front-end,

- Edit `index.html` to change the content of the webpage.
- Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,

- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (you cannot see it.)

Click `Show` in the header to see the app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy.
